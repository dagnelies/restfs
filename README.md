This is a collection of tools regarding file 

- fs2http
- http2fm
- http2

"editor" and "preview" together only makes sense for files like `html` and `md`

However, `html` preview over FTP would not make sense
And editor over HTTP would not make sense either

FTP => always one or the other
HTTP => always preview only

----

But we need a special editor with:

FTP Mode editor
HTTP Mode preview
